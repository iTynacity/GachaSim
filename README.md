# Gacha Pull Simulator

Copied and modified from: `https://github.com/aesoopIT/afk_companion` Please reference readme.md file there for further detailed program use instructions. 

A high-performance C++ application that simulates pull/drop rates for a gacha-style system. Results can be visualized using an accompanying Python scriptâ€”Shoutout to SaiLus for the original Python scripting.

This project is designed for speed, capable of running millions of simulations in seconds. It has two modes:
* **Target Souls Mode**: Calculates the number of pulls required to obtain a specific number of "souls."
* **Fixed Pulls Mode**: Calculates the number of souls obtained from a fixed number of pulls.

## Core Files

* `main.cpp`: The core C++ simulation logic, optimized for performance with multithreading.
* `CMakeLists.txt`: Build instructions for CMake, configured for a portable, statically-linked executable.
* `visualize.py`: A Python script to plot the simulation results using Matplotlib.

## How to Build and Run

## 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/iTynacity/GachaSim.git](https://github.com/iTynacity/GachaSim.git)
cd GachaSim
```
## 2. Build the Program
The build commands depend on your operating system and toolchain.

### Windows (Visual Studio Method - Recommended)
This is the simplest method for Windows.

1. Install Build Tools for Visual Studio.

    * During installation, select the "Desktop development with C++" workload. This installs the compiler and CMake automatically.

3. Install Python for visualization.

    * Install Python from the official Python website.

    * Important: Check the box that says "Add python.exe to PATH" during installation.

    * Open a new terminal and install the required packages:
      ```bash
      pip install pandas matplotlib scipy
      ```
4. Open a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run the following:
    ```bash 
    # Configure the build
     cmake -S . -B build

    # Compile the program in Release mode for performance
     cmake --build build --config Release
    ```
### Windows (MinGW/MSYS2 Method - What I Use)
For users who prefer the GCC compiler on Windows.

1. Install MSYS2.

2. Open the MSYS2 MINGW64 terminal from your Start Menu.

3. Install all required tools (C++ compiler, CMake, Python, and libraries) with this single command. Press `Y` when prompted.
    ```bash
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-python-pip mingw-w64-x86_64-python-pandas mingw-w64-x86_64-python-matplotlib mingw-w64-x86_64-python-scipy
    ```
4. From the same MSYS2 MINGW64 terminal, run the build commands:
   ```bash
   # Configure the build
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

   # Compile the program
    cmake --build build
    ```
### MacOS or Linux (Untested)
1. Install the necessary build tools.

    * **On macOS**: `xcode-select --install and brew install cmake`

    * **On Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install build-essential cmake`

2. Install Python and libraries for visualization.

    * **On macOS**: `brew install python`

    * **On Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`

Then, install the required packages: `pip3 install pandas matplotlib scipy`

3. Run the build commands:
   ```bash
   # Configure and build in Release mode
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build
   ```
   
## 3. Run the Simulation
Execute the program from your terminal inside the build path.
### For Visual Studio builds
```bash
.\build\Release\GachaSimulator.exe
```
### For MinGW, macOS, or Linux builds
```bash
./build/GachaSimulator
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to run a simulation. This will generate a `.csv` results file (e.g., `soul_results.csv`).

## 4. Visualize the Results
Use the Python script to generate a plot from the `.csv` file. You must specify which mode you ran (`1` for Target Souls, `2` for Fixed Pulls).
### Example for a Mode 2 simulation
```bash
# Windows
python visualize.py 2

# MacOS/Linux
python3 visualize.py 2
```
A plot window will appear showing a histogram of your results.
